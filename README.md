# MMScaner
A document scanner that is built with **iOS Core Image**, no 3rd lib (e.g OpenCV) is involved.

The scanner detects and presents the edges of the document on the camera view.
After the capture button is clicked, the document area is cropped out of the whole image automatically.
Manually cropping of the document area is also supported.
